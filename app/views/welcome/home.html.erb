				Aaron Groch: Your Friendly Neighborhood Web-Developer
			</h3>
			<p>
				Hi, my name's Aaron and I want to help you and your company increase their presence on the Internet. Let's work together to make your corner of the Web innovative, eye-catching, and fun!
			</p>
			<h5>First a lil' bit about me:</h5>
			<p>
				I live in Atlanta, Georgia with my wife, soon-to-come baby, and our three cats. I am originally from California, but have lived here in ATL for three years, and have also made my home in South Carolina, Morroco and Dubai!
			</p>
			<p>
				I love travelling, geography (see the link to my Sporcle geography quizes below, as well as my own geo-quiz web app on this site), and cooking.
			<p>
				Learn more about my web development and design skills further down the page.
