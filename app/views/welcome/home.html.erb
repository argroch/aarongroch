				Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up. Everyone's a hero in their own way, in their own not that heroic way. Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness. I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time, but we gotta move. Yes, I'd forgotten you're moonlighting as a criminal mastermind now. We don't have wings, we just skate around with perfect hair fighting crime. I'll kill a man in a fair fight. Or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight. Or if he bothers me. Or if there's a woman. Or if I'm getting paid. Mostly when I'm getting paid. Freedom is life's great lie.

				I don't want to use the word genius, but I'd be ok if you wanted to. I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time, but we gotta move. You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes! One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality. Basically, this is what some of your more famous serial killers' brains look like. My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do? My egg is Jewish. Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up.

				Don't strain your brain trying, then. Might break something. My Uncle Rory was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat. Hey, no, we'll just set course for Planet of the Lonely, Rich, and Appropriately Hygienic Man. Don't care much for fancy parties. Too rough. Anyone in this much pain prays, or at least curses. If the apocalypse comes...beep me! I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic lowlife community.
